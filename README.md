Networking and Cybersecurity:

What do you know 

•	Defense Against Cyber-Attacks: I possess a solid understanding of common attack vectors like malware, phishing. I can analyze vulnerabilities, implement preventive measures, and respond effectively to breaches. Examples include coursework in “Network Security”.

•	Vulnerability Assessment and Management: I can identify, prioritize, and remediate security vulnerabilities in networks and systems. My knowledge of vulnerability scanning tools and mitigation strategies stems from exercises like "" and self-guided learning through resources.

•	Network Security Checkup: I can perform comprehensive security assessments of networks, analyzing configurations, identifying vulnerabilities, and suggesting improvements. This skill developed through hands-on labs in courses like “Network Security”.

•	Web Security: I understand the unique challenges of web security, including injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and session hijacking. I can contribute to secure web development practices and identify vulnerabilities in web applications. This knowledge comes from exercises “ShieldsUP”, “Have I been pwned?”.

•	Legal and Ethical Issues: I appreciate the legal and ethical considerations surrounding computer security, including data privacy regulations and responsible disclosure practices.

•	Common Attacking Techniques and Risk Assessment: I possess a grasp of common attacker methodologies and can perform risk assessments to identify potential threats and prioritize mitigation efforts. This understanding comes from course like "Network Security".

Where are you weak

•	Security Policies, Contingency Planning, and Business Continuity: I recognize the importance of establishing and enforcing security policies, but I need to deepen my knowledge in creating and implementing them effectively. Additionally, I need to further explore contingency and continuity planning frameworks to ensure business resilience in case of disruptions. This area requires further exercises like RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN, security audit report.

•	Web Application Security: While I have a basic understanding of web application security vulnerabilities, I need to delve deeper into secure coding practices and advanced web security concepts. This can be achieved through specialized courses on web application security frameworks and penetration testing tools like “ShieldsUP”, “Have I been pwned?”.

•	Governance and Security Policy: While I understand the importance of governance in cybersecurity, I need to expand my knowledge on security policy frameworks and compliance requirements.

•	Threat Vulnerability Management (TVM): My understanding of TVM processes and tools needs further development. 

Future

•	Specialization: I am eager to specialize in a specific area within cybersecurity, potentially cloud security or incident response. This will involve further targeted learning and potentially pursuing industry certifications relevant to the chosen specialization.

•	Open-Source Contributions: I aspire to contribute to open-source security projects, gaining practical experience and collaborating with the community. This will enhance my understanding of real-world security challenges and solutions.

•	Continuous Learning: I am committed to continuous learning in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape. I plan to stay updated on emerging threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices through ongoing research, attending industry conferences, and engaging with online communities.

Capstone project idea shared with Dr. Jennex feedback:

Detecting fraud for bank customers, social engineering factor relate to Cybersecurity, build a fraud model, identify suspicious or unusual activities from customer transactions, build an automatically alert system, if bank cannot reach to customers, build an automatically locking system for secure their accounts, develop a contingency plan, and security audit plan.
